# AT command library

**This is a work in progress.  Use at your own risk**

The AT command library is a Go library for communicating with mobile
network IoT modules via their AT command set.  Currently only the
uBlox Sara N210/N211 is supported, but this library might work with
the uBlox N310 too.

As mentioned above this is a work in progress so expect things to
change around and maintainance of this library to be somewhat
episodic.
